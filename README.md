# TestMySQLConnection
Test MySQL 6.10.5 connection via uwp and winform. There is a connection bug in uwp.

Let us wait for MYSQL's reply.




======================================================================



I submit a bug on https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=89266

And according to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/19783, you need to set project min version to 16299, then the mysql connect can be open.



This is so crazy. Microsoft says System.Net.Security will be available for UWP platform in .NET Core 2.1 release timeframe.

Fuck!!!
